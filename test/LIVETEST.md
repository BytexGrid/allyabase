# Live Test

The live test of allyabase will aggregate public keys from everyone who has ever worked on or been engaged with any Planet Nine software.
We will perform at least one transaction via [MAGIC][magic] that splits payment between whatever keys have been aggregated. 

## How to join the test:

### Developers

* Grab the [Sessionless][sessionless] implementation of your choice.

* Generate a keypair

* Follow the documentation for [addie][addie] to register at https://livetest.addie.allyabase.com, and then create an account token for yourself for the processor stripe

* Follow the documentation for [fount][fount] to register at https://livetest.fount.allyabase.com

* Share your public key with planetnineisaspaceship aka Zach

(if you don't have time for all this you can use the website below too, but it'd be great to test the docs a bit). 

### Non-developers

* Go to livetest.allyabase.com, click the button, and then share the public key that appears with planetnineisaspaceship aka Zach.

## Where and when

The test will take place on Twitch so that people can watch it wherever they are. 
I do not have a time yet, but it should be before the end of the month.
